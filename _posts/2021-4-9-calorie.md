This is my first post related to health and wellness, so let's start with an obvious one.   
Calories:
You might have heard this word many times, but few of you might know your daily calorie requirement. Total daily Energy expenditure is the amount of calorie or energy your body needs to maintain your weight. Currently, my TDEE is 2800; you can calculate by wntring the details below.

There are three macros that you consume daily:  
Fat(coconut Oil, ü•ë), protein(chicken, beef, lentils, üêü) and carbohydrates(rice, ü•≠)  
Calorie per gram of macro consumed:  
F - 9 Cal/g  
C - 4 Cal/g  
P - 4 Cal/g  
To lose fat, you have to eat daily at a caloric restriction of 500-100, so you lose half KG(7700 calorie is 1KG) in a week. You can also increase your exercise to burn more calories.  

One thing that you have to consider is the amount of Protein you consume. If you consume less protein on a caloric restriction, your body burns muscles instead of fat.  
To gain muscle while doing resistance training, you have to eat at a caloric surplus of roughly 300 calories.

Is a calorie a calorie?   
There is a lot of argument about this in the community, but let me tell you that all calories are not the same; a calorie from sugar is not the same as lettuce. Zero-calorie coke is not going to pass through your body without causing a dent. Our body metabolites different things differently. This is why you should stay away from processed food(more on that later).
Let me know if you have any questions.

Tip: You can use apps like HealthifyMe to track your calorie easily. It also helps in being mindful of what you eat in a day.

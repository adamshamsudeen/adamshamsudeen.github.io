title: Using GoLang to heat up my Macbook pro
---


I've been working with Python for sometime now. For the past 6 months I've been learning more about async programming in python.
Every once in a while I hear about go channels and how amazing it, but never got a chance to start learning.

During my python async journey, very tiresome since the async documentation for python 3.6 sucked.  

I recently got a new Macbook Pro, when ever I run chrome, VSCode and Docker containers it heats up but I never heard the fan spinning.

So I took on a challenge to make my fan spin by using multiple cores.  

At that time I was learning about go channels and goroutines.
